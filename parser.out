Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . command
    (1) command -> . ACTION type
    (4) command -> . SYS

    ACTION          shift and go to state 2
    SYS             shift and go to state 3

    command                        shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> command .



state 2

    (1) command -> ACTION . type
    (2) type -> . TYPE NAME
    (3) type -> . TYPE PATH

    TYPE            shift and go to state 5

    type                           shift and go to state 4

state 3

    (4) command -> SYS .

    $end            reduce using rule 4 (command -> SYS .)


state 4

    (1) command -> ACTION type .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (command -> ACTION type .)


state 5

    (2) type -> TYPE . NAME
    (3) type -> TYPE . PATH

    NAME            shift and go to state 6
    PATH            shift and go to state 7


state 6

    (2) type -> TYPE NAME .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (type -> TYPE NAME .)


state 7

    (3) type -> TYPE PATH .

    $end            reduce using rule 3 (type -> TYPE PATH .)
